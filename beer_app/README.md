<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

- The data is used app level state with useContext Hook.

- for the rout is used react-router

- for more details about a specific Item I used useParams from react-router-dom

- for api call used axios

- About the design. The first go I used MaterialUI, then I changed back to normal CSS. Because the project is small, I left the design with vanilla CSS.
  I could choose sass, materialUI or I would build a custom class based css design.

- Future implementation - Page pagination. Using react-paginate with own style of css

- Unit testing it's not done yet.
